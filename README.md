- ‚ö° **Redis Integration:** Pre-configured Redis support for caching and real-time data processing needs.
- üîê **Authentication and Authorization:** Built-in JWT-based authentication module to handle user sessions securely, including registration, login, and user management APIs.
- üìÑ **API Documentation:** Auto-generated API documentation using NestJS DTOs.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Validation and Error Handling:** Utilizes `class-validator` for easy validation through decorators, alongside custom exceptions with tailored messages and validation responses to ensure robust error handling.
- üê≥ **Docker Support:** Ready-to-use Docker and Docker Compose configurations for containerized deployment, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **AWS Integration:** Built-in support for AWS SNS and SQS, offering powerful tools for asynchronous communication and event-driven architectures.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

- **`libs/` :**

  - This folder contains shared libraries generated using the NestJS CLI command `nest g library LIB_NAME`. These libraries can be reused across different modules in the application, promoting modularity and code reuse.

  - **`common/` :**

    - Contains shared utilities and components that are used across various modules in the application.

    - **`constants/`:** Contains constant values used throughout the application, such as configurations and settings

    - **`decorators/`:** Houses custom decorators that simplify and enhance the functionality of your code.

    - **`dtos/`:** Contains shared Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) used across multiple modules.

    - **`enums/`:** Stores enumerations that define a set of named constants, which can be used to represent a collection of related values in a type-safe manner.

    - **`exceptions/`:** Contains custom exceptions that extend the standard NestJS exceptions, providing more specific error handling across the application.

    - **`guards/`:** Includes custom guards that control access to routes based on certain conditions.

    - **`interceptors/`:** Houses custom interceptors that modify incoming requests or outgoing responses, such as logging, transformation, or error handling.

    - **`pipes/`:** Contains custom pipes that transform or validate data before it is processed by the controller. Pipes can be used for tasks like data validation, parsing, or formatting.

    - **`transformers/`:** Includes transformers that modify data between different layers of the application.

    - **`utils/`:** Stores utility functions and helpers that provide reusable functionality across the application, such as formatting dates, generating tokens, or handling common logic.

  - **`database/` :**

    - **`postgres/` :**

      - Contains configurations and setup for PostgreSQL integration, including TypeORM support and migration management.

      - **`entities/`:** Houses TypeORM entity definitions that map to database tables. These entities define the structure of your database and are used by TypeORM to perform CRUD operations. Each entity represents a model in your application and is directly tied to a specific database table.

      - **`migrations/`:** Contains migration files that handle changes to the database schema. Migrations can be generated using the command `npm run migrations:generate --name=MIGRATION_NAME`.

    - **`redis/` :**
      - Contains configuration and setup for Redis integration. Redis is used for caching and real-time data processing. This folder includes setup files to integrate Redis into the application, enhancing performance and enabling features like session management and caching.

  - **`swagger/`:**
    - **`responses/`**: Defines custom Swagger responses for different HTTP statuses.
      - `config.ts`: Contains Swagger configuration settings.
      - `index.ts`: Entry point for the Swagger configuration.
      - `swagger.decorator.ts`: A decorator to simplify Swagger documentation creation for routes.
      - `swagger.type.ts`: Contains all type definitions used in the Swagger configuration.
      - `tsconfig.lib.json`: TypeScript configuration specific to the Swagger library.

- **`src/` :**

  The `src` folder is the core of the application. It contains the main application entry point and the organization of various features through modules.

  - **`main.ts:`** This file is the entry point of the NestJS application. It initializes the NestJS application by creating an instance of the `NestFactory` and setting up the application module. It is responsible for bootstrapping the entire application and configuring global settings, such as middlewares and exception filters.

  - **`modules/`:** Houses all the application modules, each encapsulating a specific feature or domain of the application. Modules in this folder adhere to the modular design principles of NestJS, promoting separation of concerns and code reusability. Each module typically includes its own set of controllers, services, and providers, organizing related functionality and business logic into cohesive units.

  - **`infrastructure/`:** Centralizes foundational modules and services that are globally required across the NestJS application.

    - **`infrastructure.module.ts`:** A centralized module for infrastructure services and modules.

    - **`aws/`:** Contains AWS-specific modules and services:

      - **`aws.module.ts`:** The AWS module aggregates and organizes services related to AWS integrations.
      - **`sns/`:** Handles SNS connection and provides `SnsService` for SNS communication.
      - **`sqs/`:** Manages SQS connection and polling.

    - **`queues/`:** Implements **BullMQ** integration in the NestJS application for managing job queues and processing tasks asynchronously.

      - **`queue.module.ts`:** The `QueueModule` is the central module for configuring and managing **BullMQ** queues within the application. It handles the integration with Redis and organizes queue-related modules for modular and scalable design.

      - **`queue.service.ts`:** This file defines an abstract class `AbstractQueueService` that provides a base implementation for managing queues using **BullMQ**. It serves as a reusable foundation for creating specific queue services in the application.

      - **`queue.enum.ts`:** Defines enumerations related to queues, such as queue names or job-related statuses, to maintain consistent references across the application.

      - **`index.ts`:** Re-exports entities and services from this folder to simplify imports elsewhere in the application.

      - **`notification/`:**
        This folder contains the implementation of a working example for integrating the application with a queue using **BullMQ**. It demonstrates how to produce and process jobs, making it a reference point for building queue-based communication in the application (for working examples you can check auth.controller).

- **`docker/`:**

  - Contains configuration files and scripts related to Docker for containerizing the application.

  - **`Dockerfile:`** Defines the steps for building a Docker image for the application. It includes instructions to set up the environment, install dependencies, copy source files, and configure the application for running inside a Docker container. This file is used to create a consistent and reproducible build environment for the application.

- **`docker-compose.yml` :**

  - Defines a multi-container Docker application setup. It includes services for the NestJS application (`app`), PostgreSQL database (`postgres`), and database migrations (`postgres_migrations`). The file manages container dependencies, environment configurations, and networking, facilitating easy deployment and orchestration of the application and its associated services.

- **`.env.example`:**

  - Provides a template for environment variables required by the application. It includes placeholders for necessary configuration values such as database credentials, JWT secrets, and other settings. This file serves as a reference for creating the actual `.env` file with appropriate values for different environments (development, testing, production).

- **`eslintrc.json.mjs` :**

  - Configures ESLint for linting JavaScript/TypeScript code. It defines rules and settings for code quality and style enforcement, ensuring consistent and error-free code across the project.

- **`.prettierrc.js` :**
  - Configures Prettier for code formatting. It specifies formatting options such as indentation, line width, and quote style, ensuring that code adheres to a consistent format throughout the project.
